# hotel-booking-system
 Hotel Booking System built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and FastAPI with MySQL for the backend. The system allows users to book hotel rooms by selecting check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, and room type. The frontend form collects user details and validates inputs before sending the booking data to the backend API via a fetch() POST request. The backend, built with FastAPI, handles the booking logic: it checks whether the guest already exists in the database, stores the booking details, calculates the total price based on the stay duration, and responds with a confirmation message. MySQL is used to store guest and booking information in two linked tables (guests and bookings_data).
